# Silicon Valley Investing Summit – event images

Add these image files so the event page displays correctly:

- **cover.jpg** – main cover image (same as 4.jpg is fine)
- **1.jpg**, **2.jpg**, **3.jpg**, **4.jpg** – gallery images

Download the images from your Google Drive and save them here with these exact names.  
If you no longer have the originals, you can use any 4+ photos from the event; use one as `cover.jpg` and the rest as `1.jpg` through `4.jpg`.
